title: Forecast Views Through Video Cover Images
---
**Abstract**

Although people are aware that a good thumbnail stands out and draws viewers' attention intuitively, few studies have looked at the relationship between thumbnails and views from a machine learning perspective. Many articles just qualitatively analyze what kind of thumbnail is attractive, giving some design tips. 

Our project analyzes problems quantitatively, predicting a view range according to an input picture. We use both VGG and ResNet from machine learning to train a model for three datasets. Based on the model we build, our project proves that video views are related to its cover image and verifies some qualitative studies mentioned above. Our model helps the video producer to check whether his video cover is attractive enough in a targeted manner. Further developing, it might help us study human visual aesthetics.

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

# Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

[**NOTE AND ANSWER:**]{.underline}

We have 1004 missing values in weight. The lowest weight is 30kgs and highest weight is 181 kgs. The mean weight of the class is 68kgs and median weight is 64kgs. We can see that Q3 is 76kgs. That means 75% of the weights are between 30kgs and 76kgs. As per the histogram, it's clear that the remaining 25% of the data is really spread between 76kgs and 181kgs. This is evident in the skewness of the graph. It is right skewed and mean is larger than the median. It gives us an indication that there are some outliers that have increased the value of the mean.

```{r, eda_on_weight}
skimr::skim(yrbss)

yrbss%>%
  summarise(count_na_weight = sum(is.na(weight)))
# 1004 observations with missing weight

summary(yrbss)

#Plotting histogram of weight
yrbss %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=weight))+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Distribution of Weights", y="Number of participants", x="Weight"
  )

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler's weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let's create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. Use the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

#Adding a new column to represent those who do physical activity for atleast 3 days a week
yrbss <- yrbss %>%
    mutate( physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >=3, "Yes","No"))

yrbss
  
#Counting number of yes and no using groupby and summarise
count_yesorno <- yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  summarize(count_physical_3plus = n())%>%
  mutate(percentage = count_physical_3plus / sum(count_physical_3plus), percentage = parse_number(scales::percent(percentage)))

count_yesorno
  
#counting using count function
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  count(physical_3plus)
    
```

Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

[**ANSWER:**]{.underline}

We are 95% confident that the proportion of participants that are not active for 3 or more days is within the lower bound of 0.3229 and the upper bound 0.3389.

Make a boxplot of \`physical_3plus\` vs. \`weight\`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

[**ANSWER:**]{.underline}

We observe that there is a small positive relationship between weight and the amount of days physically active within a week. However, the difference in distribution is only minor. We conducted a small sanity check by means of calculating means and creating a best fit line plot. This confirmed that in fact the relationship between weight and physical activity is indeed small.

These findings are rather surprising! The intuition of our group was that people that are more physically active would weigh less. However, on second thought, there might be many other factors contributing to to the weight of a person apart from physical activity (e.g. diet, age, ect.). Physically active people might burn more calories, tough gain muscle weight.

```{r, boxplot}

# confidence interval calculation for a proportion (binomial)
ci_physical_3plus <- yrbss %>% 
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count_n = n(),
            mean_proportion = count(physical_3plus == "No") / count_n,
            se_proportion = sqrt(mean_proportion * (1 - mean_proportion) / count_n),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_n - 1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_proportion,
            rating_low = mean_proportion - margin_of_error,
            rating_high = mean_proportion + margin_of_error
  )
           


#Plotting boxplot of weight and physical activity atleast 3 days
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus, y=weight))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
  title = "Boxplot of weight vs physical activity", x="Phsyical activity atleast 3 days", y = "Weight"
  )

#as a small sanity check we check the age statistics and calculate a few metrics
yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus, weight, age) %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(weight),
            median = median(weight),
            mean_age = mean(age),
            median_age = median(age)
            )

yrbss %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=physically_active_7d, y=weight))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_lm() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
  title = "Lineplot of weight vs physical activity", x="Phsyical activity in 7 days", y = "Weight"
  )
```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.

```{r, ci_using_formulas}

# Subgroup physical_3plus == "Yes"    
yes_ci_using_formulas <- yrbss %>%
  filter(physical_3plus == "Yes") %>% 
  summarise(weight_count = sum(!is.na(weight)),
            weight_mean = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            weight_sd = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            weight_se = weight_sd / sqrt(weight_count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, weight_count - 1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * weight_se,
            weight_low  = weight_mean - margin_of_error,
            weight_high  = weight_mean + margin_of_error)
yes_ci_using_formulas 

# Subgroup physical_3plus == "No"
no_ci_using_formulas <- yrbss %>%
  filter(physical_3plus == "No") %>% 
  summarise(weight_count = sum(!is.na(weight)),
            weight_mean = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            weight_sd = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            weight_se = weight_sd / sqrt(weight_count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, weight_count - 1),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * weight_se,
            weight_low  = weight_mean - margin_of_error,
            weight_high  = weight_mean + margin_of_error)
no_ci_using_formulas
```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

# Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don't.

[**Answer:**]{.underline}

Let x_bar_yes be the mean of students who exercise atleast 3 times a week. Let x_bar_no be the mean of students who exercise less than 3 times a week. We will define our null hypothesis as x_bar_yes - x_bar_no = 0. If the null hypothesis is true, on average, it would signify that the weight of those who do not exercise at least 3 times a week is the same as that of those who do.

Our alternative hypothesis would be that the weight of those who do not exercise at least 3 times a week is different from that of those who do.

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

[**Note:**]{.underline}

From the t-test, we reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level; on average, the weight of individuals who are physically active for minimum 3 days a week is higher than that of those who are not.

# Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  drop_na(weight) %>%
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>% 
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Yes", "No"))

obs_diff
```

Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  drop_na(weight) %>% 
  drop_na(physical_3plus) %>% 
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Yes", "No"))

null_dist
```

Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```

Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")
```

This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

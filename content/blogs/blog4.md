**NYU Business and Economics Honors Program Program Overview** [(Program Website)](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate-research/business-honors-program) 

In parallel with the Stern Undergraduate Honors Program, which has been in existence since 2001, the NYU Shanghai Business and Economics Honors Program shares the same mission of preparing academically motivated, rising seniors for an enriched research experience that extends beyond the classroom environment. Being a part of a select cohort of honors students, participants will have the opportunity to work closely with distinguished faculty members throughout a year-long development of a thesis and attend a customized series of honors seminar. The program aims to offer an individualized and comprehensive educational experience by connecting outstanding undergraduate students at NYU Shanghai with stimulating research ideas and scholars.

**My Paper - Abstract** 

According to plenty of statistical evidence, China's aging industry has a huge development space. Many investors have started to pay more attention to the trends in this industry and want to invest more effectively in this area. However, due to the unscientific way of index stock selection, sometimes industry indexes do not represent the industry trends and cause a resource mismatch in the stock market.

This paper digs into the case of the Chinese aging industry. It analyzes a Chinese aging industry index called the CSI Old-Age Industry Index, a significant industry indicator in China. It reconstructs a Chinese aging industry index with better performance in the industry measurement. The whole process can be divided into three stages: Firm Selection, Index Construction, and Evaluation.

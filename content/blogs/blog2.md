Hello! I'm Sharon Wenyu Xu. I'm from China and just graduated from *New York University* this year. I studied **Data Science** and **Finance** during undergrad and I am currently reading for **the Masters in Analytics and Management** at *London Business School.* I would like to introduce myself a little bit from three perspective.


 -   **Strong Strategic and Quantitative Perspective**: I have been gifted with logical thinking since I was a child. I studied Go, a Chinese strategy board game, since I was 3 years old and have won two championships. During undergrad, I conducted many programming projects. For instance, I've built a machine learning model that can forecast the number of views given the video thumbnail on video platforms.


 -   **Innovative and Entrepreneurial Spirit**: I have always been driven by the desire to create something new to leave a sustainable impact on business and people. Working as a data analyst at a hearing aid start-up, I created an automatic data dashboard for all teams to trace the dynamics of website traffic, improving the traffic quality with an increase in user average engagement time by 80% in 1 month.


 -   **Inclusive Leadership Skills**: As the elected Orientation Ambassador out of all classes at NYU Shanghai, I facilitated a series of activities for over 500 freshmen from more than 60 countries. As a group leader for 15 students from a variety of cultural backgrounds, I successfully organized 10+ weekly "first-year dialogue" workshops with a 100% positive rating.


I'm currently open to any internship and full-time opportunities. Here is my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-wenyu-xu) profile. Feel free to email me at sxu.mam2023@london.edu, or check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fP6XgDyLYlJwz0fxReaXIDEgFugbEmLZ/view?usp=sharing) here!
